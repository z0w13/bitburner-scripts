## Extension Recommendations
* [vscode-eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) to use live linting in editor
* [auto-snippet](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.auto-snippet) to automate inserting the file template in `.vscode/snippets.code-snippets`

There is a workspace file in `.vscode` which contains the recommended settings for all of these

## Dependencies
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) required for compiling typescript and installing dependencies
* Make

## Installation
```sh
git clone https://github.com/z0w13/bitburner-scripts.git
pnpm install
make watch
```

## Deugging

For debugging bitburner on Steam you will need to enable a remote debugging port. This can be done by rightclicking bitburner in your Steam library and selecting properties. There you need to add `--remote-debugging-port=9222` [Thanks @DarkMio]

When debugging you see errors like the following:

```
Could not read source map for file:///path/to/Steam/steamapps/common/Bitburner/resources/app/dist/ext/monaco-editor/min/vs/editor/editor.main.js: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/path/to/Steam/steamapps/common/Bitburner/resources/app/dist/ext/monaco-editor/min/vs/editor/editor.main.js.map'
```

These errors are to be expected, they are referring to the game's files and the game does not come packaged with sourcemaps.
